//!
//! @section install Description
//! This embedded application source code illustrates how to implement a simple USB host application
//! with HID mouse support.
//!
//! To use the application, the SK525 should be configured to be self powered (see STK525
//! hardware manual).
//! @note The application can also be used with the USBKey in host mode (powered with an external battery)
//!
//!
//! @section sample About the sample application
//! The application use  host operating mode of the STK525.
//! In host mode, the USB can be connected (with a mini A connector attached to the mini AB STK525 receptacle)
//! to a standard USB mouse (or another STK525 running device mouse application). In this mode the AT90USBxxx controller
//! will initialize and enumerate a device HID mouse application.

//!
//! @section src_code About the source code
//! This source code is usable with the following compilers:
//! - IAR Embedded Workbench (5.11A and higher)
//! - AVRGCC (WinAVR 20080411 and higher).
//!
//! Support for other compilers may required modifications or attention for:
//! - compiler.h file 
//! - special registers declaration file
//! - interrupt subroutines declarations
//!
//! @section arch Architecture
//! As illustrated in the figure bellow, the application entry point is located is the main.c file.
//! The main function first performs the initialization of a scheduler module and then runs it in an infinite loop.
//! The scheduler is a simple infinite loop calling all its tasks defined in the conf_scheduler.h file.
//! No real time schedule is performed, when a task ends, the scheduler calls the next task defined in
//! the configuration file (conf_scheduler.h).
//!
//! The application is based on four different tasks:
//! - The usb_task  (usb_task.c associated source file), is the task performing the USB low level
//! enumeration process in device mode or host mode.
//! - The host_mouse_task is active allows to initialize a connected device mouse and to display mouse activity on LEDs
